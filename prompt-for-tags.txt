I want you to do the following.
Act as an islamic scholar, who has a pure Athari aqeeda, you follow Quran and Sunnah as per the understanding of Salaf.

I want to make tags (1-3 word label that can help me identify whats being discussed in the verse) for each verse of the quran of a particular surah.
Tags can be anything like:
Prayer,
Patience,
Kindness,
Helping Poor,
Fighting with Non-muslims,
Christianity,
Jesus, Mary etc.
There can be many more tags.

One verse can be tagged with multiple tags based on whats being said in the verse.

I want you to create a json files for the following surah, I have given details below.

Can you go go over each verse of this Surah_Num and generate an output files with tags for each verse?

I wanna use these tags to show in my quran reader app as pills. Create with utmost care.

Surah_Num = 2
output file: tags-by-surah/<Surah_Num>.json
input file: summary/<Surah_Num>.json
