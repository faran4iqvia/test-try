      "text": "This verse opens with a rhetorical question asking what the people are inquiring about among themselves, presenting a beautiful scene of restlessness and commotion that arose among the people of Mecca due to the Prophet's message. The verse captures the atmosphere where every person seems preoccupied with the same question about what new message Muhammad has brought. The people are questioning how this world could possibly end one day, how resurrection could occur, how all humans could be brought back to life, and how every person could be held accountable for their individual deeds. They wonder how it's possible that no one will be able to help anyone else, expressing disbelief that the dead could be resurrected, that such vast numbers could be judged, and that every single action could be evaluated. The verse depicts every household in Mecca engaged in such discussions, every gathering and meeting place buzzing with these questions, and the entire city's atmosphere revolving around this single topic of divine accountability and resurrection."

This great announcement represents one of the most significant matters that could be communicated to humanity, as it fundamentally challenges their understanding of life's purpose and ultimate destiny. The description as 'great news' emphasizes the magnitude and importance of the resurrection message, which represents a complete transformation of human existence from temporary worldly life to eternal accountability. This news is characterized as great because it affects every human being and determines their eternal fate based on their earthly choices and actions. The questioning about this great news reveals the people's struggle to comprehend and accept such a momentous concept that challenges their materialistic worldview."

      "text": "The verse describes how the people have fallen into disagreement and differing opinions regarding this great news of resurrection and judgment. Upon hearing the details about the Day of Judgment, different people express various opinions and reactions, with some claiming that resurrection after death is completely implausible and beyond rational belief. Others argue that with their gods and intercessors protecting them, no accountability or judgment could possibly affect them. The verse captures the diversity of skeptical responses, where everyone offers their own opinion and interpretation, resulting in as many different views as there are speakers. This disagreement reflects the natural human tendency to reject uncomfortable truths that challenge established beliefs and lifestyles, leading to a cacophony of denial and rationalization rather than serious consideration of the message's implications."

When the appointed time arrives, these people will witness with their own eyes everything they currently reject and deny. The verse implies that their skepticism is temporary and will be replaced by certain knowledge when they face the actual experience of death and resurrection. This declaration serves both as a warning to the deniers and a reassurance to believers that divine truth will ultimately be vindicated regardless of current human opinions and arguments."

The grave represents the first station of the intermediate realm, and upon reaching this station, every human being comes to know the true reality. The time is not far when each of these skeptical individuals will have the real facts revealed to them clearly and undeniably.
