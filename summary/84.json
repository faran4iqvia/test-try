      "text": "When the sky is split apart, this verse introduces one of the dramatic cosmic signs that will herald the arrival of the Day of Judgment and the end of the current worldly order. The splitting of the heavens represents a fundamental transformation of the cosmic structure that has remained stable and orderly throughout human history. This cosmic upheaval serves as the opening sign of a series of events that will completely transform the familiar world and prepare it for divine judgment and the implementation of eternal consequences for human actions.\n\nThe basic theme of this and related chapters focuses on reminding humanity about the afterlife and the inevitable accountability that awaits every person. The cosmic transformations described serve not merely as dramatic imagery but as concrete signs that will mark the transition from the temporary period of earthly testing to the permanent period of divine justice and eternal consequences. This splitting of the sky represents the beginning of the end of the current cosmic order and the establishment of conditions suitable for comprehensive divine judgment of all human souls."

      "text": "The sky will listen attentively to its Lord's command and comply with divine instructions, as is fitting and proper for all creation in relation to the Creator. The literal meaning suggests that the heavens are listening carefully with full attention to divine commands, and when something is heard with such focused attention, it is naturally followed by complete obedience and implementation. The word used indicates both careful listening and complete submission to divine will, demonstrating the proper relationship between created things and their Creator.\n\nThis verse establishes that it is entirely appropriate and necessary for all creation to submit completely to divine commands without question or resistance. The heavens serve as an example of perfect obedience and submission to divine authority, demonstrating the attitude that all creation should maintain toward the Creator's commands. This complete compliance with divine will represents the natural order of the universe, where everything except rebellious humans submits willingly to the Creator's authority and fulfills its designated role in the cosmic plan."

The repetition reinforces that such perfect obedience and immediate response to divine commands represents the natural and appropriate behavior for all created things when faced with the authority of their Creator. The heavens demonstrate the ideal model of submission that reflects recognition of divine sovereignty and authority.\n\nThe emphasis on this being fitting and proper establishes that complete submission to divine commands is not arbitrary or imposed against the natural order, but rather represents the fulfillment of the proper relationship between Creator and creation. This willing compliance demonstrates the wisdom and justice of divine authority, which deserves complete obedience from all created beings. The heavens' example serves as a contrast to human rebellion and provides a model for how rational beings should respond to divine guidance and commands."

This parallels the description in Surah Az-Zalzalah about the earth bringing forth its burdens, indicating that on the Day of Judgment the earth will expel all human bodies and their components that have been buried within it over the course of human history. This represents a complete emptying of all the deceased who have been committed to the earth for burial.\n\nIn addition to human remains, the earth will also cast out all the minerals, treasures, and hidden wealth that have been concealed within its depths throughout history. This complete evacuation demonstrates that the earth will hold nothing back on the Day of Judgment, making available all the resources and evidence needed for comprehensive divine justice. The emptying of the earth represents both the resurrection of all humans for judgment and the revelation of all hidden wealth and resources that will no longer have any worldly significance in the face of eternal spiritual consequences."

This parallel structure emphasizes that both the heavens above and the earth below will demonstrate perfect obedience and submission when divine commands are issued for the cosmic transformation that will herald the Day of Judgment. The earth's compliance mirrors the heavens' submission, showing that all elements of creation respond appropriately to divine authority.\n\nThis universal submission of both celestial and terrestrial elements demonstrates that the cosmic changes associated with the Day of Judgment represent the natural fulfillment of divine will rather than arbitrary disruption of the natural order. The willing compliance of both heavens and earth serves as a powerful contrast to human rebellion and demonstrates the proper attitude that rational beings should maintain toward divine authority. This coordinated obedience of all cosmic elements ensures that divine judgment will be implemented smoothly and completely according to divine plan and timing."

      "text": "O human being! You are continuously struggling and enduring hardship after hardship in your journey toward your Lord, and you will certainly meet Him for accountability. This world represents a house of trials and tribulations for humanity, where struggle, difficulty, and hardship constitute the fundamental nature of human existence. As described in Surah Al-Balad, humans are created in a state of struggle and difficulty, making the endurance of hardships, suffering, and trials an inescapable part of human destiny from which no person can find relief during their earthly life.\n\nWhether someone is a laborer enduring physical hardships from morning to evening, a business owner struggling with administrative complexities, or an office worker grinding through mental challenges, everyone faces their share of difficulties. Beyond professional struggles, every person deals with mental and psychological pressures related to health concerns for themselves and their families, economic difficulties, social complications, and worries about protecting their wealth and lives. Additionally, everyone carries some level of competitive stress and comparison with others, whether it's a pedestrian envying a cyclist, a cyclist envying a car owner, or a small car owner feeling jealous of those with larger vehicles. While the nature of struggles may vary, every human being is involved in some form of difficulty, worry, or hardship that has persisted since the beginning of human existence and will continue until the end of time."

While other living creatures may endure difficult lives, their struggles end with death and they find permanent relief from their difficulties. A draft animal that dies while pulling a plow or operating a water wheel finds eternal rest from its labors. However, humans face a much more complex situation because after enduring countless hardships and difficulties throughout their earthly existence, they must stand before their Lord to give account for every moment of their worldly life.\n\nThe prophetic tradition explains that no human being will be able to move from their position before their Lord on the Day of Judgment until they have been questioned about five specific matters: how they spent their lifetime, how they utilized their youth and its energies and aspirations, where they earned their wealth and how they spent it (whether through lawful means or unlawful methods, and whether spent on legitimate needs or frivolous pursuits), and how much they acted upon the knowledge they acquired. This represents the true tragedy of human existence - not only must people endure worldly struggles, but they must also face comprehensive accountability before the One from whom even their deepest thoughts and feelings cannot be hidden."

The nature of this easy accounting is clarified through a prophetic tradition where the Prophet was asked about the meaning of easy accounting. He explained that anyone who undergoes detailed examination and questioning on the Day of Judgment will certainly be punished, but the easy accounting mentioned in this verse is not actually a detailed examination at all.\n\nInstead, it represents a simple presentation of the person's record of deeds, where their actions are briefly reviewed and their errors are forgiven without detailed questioning or investigation. The Prophet clarified that anyone whose deeds are subjected to detailed scrutiny and analysis will face punishment, but those who receive Allah's mercy will have their record books simply presented to them and then be granted forgiveness for their mistakes. This represents Allah's gentle treatment of righteous servants, where their good deeds are acknowledged and their errors are overlooked without subjecting them to the stress and difficulty of comprehensive examination and cross-questioning."

After the divine court has completed its merciful review of their deeds and granted them forgiveness, this blessed individual will return to their family members, relatives, and companions who have similarly been forgiven and granted salvation. The reunion with loved ones who have also received divine mercy will be a source of tremendous joy and celebration.\n\nThis joyful return to family represents the restoration of social bonds and relationships in the context of eternal salvation, where the righteous are not only individually saved but are also reunited with their righteous family members and companions in a state of permanent happiness. The person's joy stems not only from their own salvation but also from discovering that their loved ones have similarly received divine forgiveness and mercy. This communal aspect of salvation demonstrates that divine mercy extends beyond individual righteousness to encompass the restoration of social relationships and family bonds in the eternal realm."

      "text": "As for the one who is given their record book from behind their back, this refers to those who will receive their books of deeds in their left hand, which is mentioned in most Quranic verses about the wicked receiving their records. The specific phrase about receiving it from behind the back suggests a scenario where the angel attempting to give the criminal their record book will find them trying to avoid receiving it. In their shame and fear, they will hide their left hand behind their back to avoid taking the book that contains the record of their evil deeds.\n\nThis behavior demonstrates the criminal's awareness of their guilt and their futile attempt to avoid facing the consequences of their earthly conduct. The positioning of receiving the book from behind the back indicates both their shame at their deeds and their desperate but hopeless attempt to delay or avoid the moment of accountability. This physical manifestation of their internal state reveals their understanding that the record contains evidence of their wrongdoing that will result in severe punishment. The awkward positioning emphasizes the humiliation and distress that will characterize the experience of those who rejected divine guidance during their earthly lives."

At that moment, their only wish will be for death to come to them so they can die and be completely finished rather than face the punishment that awaits them. This represents the ultimate despair of those who realize the magnitude of their spiritual failure and the severity of the consequences they must face as a result of their earthly rebellion against divine guidance.\n\nThe call for death demonstrates the complete hopelessness and regret that will overwhelm those who spent their earthly lives in rejection of divine guidance and pursuit of selfish desires without regard for spiritual consequences. Their wish for annihilation reflects their recognition that facing eternal punishment is worse than non-existence, revealing the magnitude of the spiritual disaster they have brought upon themselves through their earthly choices. This desperate desire for death represents the final realization of the ultimate futility of their worldly pursuits and the devastating consequences of rejecting divine guidance during the period when repentance and spiritual correction were still possible."

The repetition reinforces the intensity of their regret and their overwhelming desire to escape through non-existence rather than face the punishment that their deeds have earned. Their call for death represents the final recognition of the magnitude of their spiritual disaster.\n\nThe persistence of this theme demonstrates that the horror of divine punishment will be so overwhelming that even existence itself will seem preferable to facing the consequences of earthly choices. This desperate wish for annihilation serves as a powerful warning about the importance of making proper spiritual choices during earthly life, when opportunities for repentance and spiritual development are still available. The complete despair expressed through the call for death illustrates the ultimate futility of rejecting divine guidance in favor of temporary worldly pleasures that lead to eternal regret and suffering."

      "text": "Indeed, this person was joyful and content among their family during worldly life, living in luxury with their relatives through unlawful earnings while never considering the accountability of the afterlife. They enjoyed themselves with family and wealth obtained through forbidden means without ever bringing to mind the concept of divine accountability and judgment. This verse introduces an important principle: even if someone earns their livelihood through completely lawful means but fails to fulfill their obligations toward Allah's religion, then such earnings are not truly lawful because they have usurped the portion of their time, abilities, and resources that should have been dedicated to religious duties.\n\nThe concept of lawful and unlawful must be examined with great precision and depth, as it is unfortunately often viewed in a superficial manner. For example, a Muslim might never consider eating pork but will readily consume meat purchased with money obtained through theft or corruption. Such meat cannot be considered lawful regardless of the animal's permissible nature. Similarly, if a Muslim lives comfortably under the dominance of a false system without struggling to change it, then even their carefully measured lawful food becomes unlawful, and even breathing in such an environment becomes forbidden. Such a person should consider whose system they are serving, whose authority they are supporting, where their salary comes from, and through whose help they are advancing their business. Living happily under a false system while supporting the powers of falsehood is not permissible for any Muslim unless they live in constant distress and restlessness, minimize their needs, and remain constantly prepared to sacrifice everything to change the false system."

The detailed analysis reveals that true lawfulness requires not only avoiding obviously forbidden sources of income but also ensuring that one's entire lifestyle and social position align with divine guidance and religious responsibilities. The comfortable family life described represents a fundamental spiritual error when it comes at the expense of religious duties.\n\nThe verse contrasts two types of human characters: one represents Allah's servant who lived in constant awareness and fear of afterlife accountability, remaining anxious and concerned throughout their earthly life about divine judgment. Such people will experience such intense fear of divine accountability that they will remember this spiritual anxiety even after reaching Paradise, as mentioned in Surah At-Tur where they will say they used to live in fear among their families in worldly life. After hearing the good news of success from Allah's court, such a person will return to their family members with joy and happiness. In contrast, the other character represents someone who lived obliviously regarding the afterlife and its accountability, remaining absorbed in pleasure and luxury with family members. Such a person undoubtedly lived a prosperous and joyful worldly life, but nothing awaits them in the afterlife except the fire of Hell."

      "text": "Indeed, their Lord was watching them closely, representing divine awareness and knowledge of all their actions and choices during their earthly existence. The following three verses contain three divine oaths that bear special resemblance and deep similarity to corresponding verses in Surah Al-Muddaththir in terms of both subject matter and style. The oaths in Al-Muddaththir include swearing by the moon, the night when it turns its back, and the morning when it becomes bright. Both sets of verses share the characteristic that they introduce completely new subject matter following the oaths.\n\nJust as Surah Al-Muddaththir begins a new theme with its oath by the moon, a similar situation appears at this point in the current chapter. This structural similarity suggests a thematic connection between the two passages, where divine oaths serve to authenticate and emphasize the importance of the messages that follow. The close divine observation mentioned in this verse establishes that nothing was hidden from Allah regarding their earthly conduct, ensuring that divine judgment will be based on complete and accurate knowledge of every action, intention, and choice made during their worldly existence."

The reference to the similarity with Surah Al-Muddaththir establishes a thematic connection between the two chapters, where divine oaths serve to introduce and authenticate important spiritual messages. The persistent emphasis on divine observation ensures that no action or intention escaped divine notice during their earthly existence.\n\nThe structural parallel with Al-Muddaththir suggests that both passages serve similar functions in introducing new themes through divine oaths that establish the authority and importance of the messages being conveyed. The divine observation mentioned serves as the foundation for perfect divine justice, ensuring that all judgments will be based on complete and accurate knowledge rather than partial information. This comprehensive awareness demonstrates that divine accountability operates according to perfect knowledge and absolute fairness in evaluating human conduct and spiritual choices made during the period of earthly testing."

This comprehensive monitoring ensures that divine judgment will be implemented with perfect accuracy and complete fairness based on full knowledge of each person's earthly conduct.\n\nThe connection to Al-Muddaththir's pattern of introducing new themes through divine oaths suggests that the current passage is preparing to present important spiritual truths that require authentication through cosmic witnesses. The emphasis on divine observation serves as both warning and assurance - warning to those who lived in rebellion that their actions were fully witnessed, and assurance to the righteous that their struggles and sacrifices were completely known and will be appropriately rewarded. This divine awareness forms the basis for perfect justice in the implementation of eternal consequences for earthly spiritual choices."

This verse is interpreted as referring to the gradual renewal and revival of Islam, which will occur in stages like the moon's phases, eventually reaching full illumination. Unlike the sudden appearance of Islamic dominance during the Prophet's time, which was like the brightness of morning sunshine, the future revival of Islam will be gradual and progressive, growing phase by phase until it reaches completion.\n\nThe interpretation suggests that the oath by the twilight represents the gradual decline of Islam from its former dominance, like the redness of sunset remaining on the horizon after the sun has set. The oath by the night and what it encompasses represents the further deterioration of religious practice globally, with only dim light remaining that will gradually grow stronger over time. The moon becoming full represents this gradually increasing light of Islamic revival, which will eventually illuminate the darkness like a full moon brightens the night. This gradual process will involve generation after generation of struggle and effort by various Islamic movements and reformers working toward the establishment of divine guidance and the righteous caliphate."

The emphatic form of the verb indicates certainty and divine assurance that this destination will definitely be reached. This news comes from the truthful and trusted Messenger, whose reports cannot be false, so the complete dominance of Islam over the world will certainly occur.\n\nHowever, the character of Islam's first dominance was different from what its second dominance will be. This difference becomes clear when comparing Surah Al-Muddaththir's reference to morning brightness with the current chapter's reference to the full moon. The first Islamic dominance appeared like morning sunshine - sudden and immediate, where the sun of prophethood rose and the entire environment became illuminated within just twenty-three years of the Prophet's mission, bringing the greatest revolution in human history to the Arabian Peninsula. But the second dominance of Islam will spread like moonlight - gradually and progressively. The establishment of divine guidance and the righteous caliphate will not occur through the efforts of any single preacher or movement or within any single generation, but through generation after generation of struggle by various Islamic movements and reformers working collectively toward this goal until Allah wills that Islam dominates the entire world as a complete way of life."

The certainty expressed in the emphatic verb form reinforces that this divinely promised outcome will definitely be achieved despite the current challenges and apparent setbacks facing the Muslim community. The progressive nature of this advancement parallels the moon's gradual growth to full illumination.\n\nThe historical examples provided demonstrate how different reformers and movements have contributed to this gradual process, each adding their efforts to the collective struggle for Islamic revival. Like the work of Allama Iqbal in clarifying that Islam is not merely a religion but a complete way of life, and the efforts of various Islamic organizations and movements in promoting the establishment of divine guidance, future generations will continue this struggle through different approaches and methods. The collective and progressive nature of these efforts will eventually result in the complete dominance of Islam as a comprehensive system of life when Allah wills it to occur."

The comprehensive nature of this struggle encompasses intellectual, social, political, and spiritual dimensions, with various organizations and individuals contributing their unique approaches and methods to the collective effort.

      "text": "Rather, these disbelievers are denying and rejecting the truth, revealing an important distinction between disbelief (kufr) and denial (takdhib) as separate concepts with different meanings rather than synonymous terms. Disbelief linguistically means concealment, referring to a person's kufr as their deliberate concealment of the testimonies about Allah's existence that He has placed within their natural constitution, knowingly hiding these testimonies and refusing to acknowledge or express them before others. Denial, on the other hand, refers to rejecting Allah's revealed signs that were sent to activate and awaken the testimonies already present in human nature.\n\nIn this sense, disbelief and denial represent two distinct crimes, with denial being the greater offense compared to disbelief. The charter given to Adam when he was sent to earth mentions both crimes separately, stating that those who disbelieve and deny divine signs will be the inhabitants of the Fire, dwelling therein forever. While disbelief might have some excuse, such as negative environmental influences causing veils of heedlessness or ignorance to cover a person's soul, preventing divine recognition from being fully reflected in their nature's mirror, denial has no acceptable excuse. When clear divine signs provide unmistakable guidance that confirms the natural call of human conscience, deliberately rejecting these signs represents inexcusable boldness and criminality that cannot be justified by any argument."

These internal spiritual toxins prevent them from accepting truth even when it is clearly presented to them, creating a barrier between their souls and divine guidance.
