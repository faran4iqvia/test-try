      "text": "Allah declares 'No!' and then swears by this city, referring to Mecca. The word 'No' here serves to reject the false beliefs and misconceptions of the addressees, similar to its usage in previous surahs like Al-Qiyamah and Al-Inshiqaq. This is not a negation of the oath itself, but rather a refutation of the incorrect ideas held by the people. The structure in English would be 'Nay, I swear by this city!' The oath by Mecca serves to emphasize the significance of this sacred place and to validate the divine message that will follow. The city being sworn by holds special importance in the context of the Prophet's mission and the truth he was conveying to his people."

      "text": "The Prophet is told that he has been made lawful in this city, referring to the unique position granted to him despite Mecca being a sacred sanctuary where violence is normally prohibited. Some interpreters understand this as a prophecy that the city would become lawful for him, as happened during the conquest of Mecca when armed conflict occurred despite the city's sacred status. However, the primary meaning refers to the current situation where the Prophet's honor is being attacked in this sacred city, where he is being continuously persecuted and harassed. In this valley without cultivation, where normal life itself is full of hardship, the opposition of the city's people has made life even more difficult and challenging for the Prophet. The verse acknowledges the hardships and persecution the Prophet is enduring while carrying out his mission of inviting people to the truth."

      "text": "Allah swears by the father and what he begets, referring to the relationship between parent and child and the associated responsibilities and hardships. This oath points to the struggle and responsibility that a father must bear in raising, nurturing, and educating his children. The mention of the father-child relationship serves to highlight the natural bonds and obligations that exist in human society, as well as the inherent difficulties and challenges involved in fulfilling parental duties. This oath sets up the context for understanding the broader theme of human struggle and responsibility that characterizes life in this world. The relationship between parent and offspring represents one of the fundamental aspects of human experience that involves both joy and significant hardship."

      "surah": 90,
      "text": "Humans have indeed been created in hardship and struggle, establishing the fundamental nature of human existence as one characterized by effort and difficulty. This theme is echoed in Surah Al-Inshiqaq, which describes humans as constantly struggling towards their Lord until they meet Him. The bitter reality of human life is that regardless of one's circumstances - whether poor or rich, powerful or weak - hardship and difficulty are everyone's destiny. Some suffer from physical labor, others from mental strain; some face emotional distress while others experience psychological turmoil. Some lack basic necessities while others find their wealth burdensome; some have no shelter while others on silk cushions long for sleep. While the nature, type, and intensity of struggle may differ among individuals, no one in this life is free from hardship and anxiety. As the poet Ghalib noted, the bonds of life and grief are essentially the same - why should anyone find freedom from sorrow before death? However, humanity's real challenge is even greater: not only must people endure all these worldly difficulties, but they must also present themselves before their Lord and account for every single deed."

      "ayah": 5,
      "surah": 90,
      "text": "Despite being surrounded by hardships, humans still display arrogance and think that no one can overpower them. The example of Abu Jahl illustrates this point - even while facing difficulties, he remained proud and defiant. This is truly remarkable: when humans surrounded by troubles and difficulties on all sides behave this way toward their Creator and Master, one can only imagine how they would rebel against Allah and oppress His creation if their worldly life consisted only of ease and comfort. The verse highlights the contradiction in human nature where people maintain arrogance and defiance even while experiencing their own limitations and vulnerabilities. This attitude demonstrates how material circumstances do not necessarily lead to spiritual humility or recognition of divine authority."

      "ayah": 6,
      "surah": 90,
      "text": "The person boasts about spending heaps of wealth, reflecting the mentality of the Quraysh leaders who often performed good deeds driven by competitive spirit and then extensively publicized their charitable acts while showing off. Most of these people's refusal to accept faith was also due to this competitive mentality, as they viewed the Prophet as a member of a rival clan and could not bear to submit to him at any cost. Abu Jahl's confession is recorded in history - when asked if he considered Muhammad to be a liar, he replied that Muhammad had never told a lie. When pressed about why he wouldn't believe in him, Abu Jahl explained that their clan had been competing with Banu Hashim for generations in every field of honor and service. If they now acknowledged Muhammad's prophethood, they would become his followers forever, which was unacceptable to him. The verse captures this attitude of the Quraysh leaders who, whenever they performed any good deed, would boast about it everywhere, claiming to have spent tremendous amounts of wealth on various charitable causes."

      "ayah": 7,

      "text": "The person thinks that no one has seen his charitable acts, questioning whether he believes that Allah, who is aware of every person's every deed, is unaware of his good works. If he truly performed those good deeds for Allah's pleasure, then why is he publicizing them and beating his own drum? This verse exposes the contradiction in claiming to do good for divine reward while simultaneously seeking public recognition and praise. True righteousness performed for Allah's sake should be done with humility and without seeking worldly acknowledgment. The question challenges the sincerity of those who perform charitable acts but then extensively advertise their generosity, suggesting that their motivation may be more about social status and reputation than genuine concern for those in need or desire for divine reward."

      "text": "This verse reiterates the question about whether the person thinks no one has witnessed his deeds, continuing to challenge the sincerity of those who publicize their charitable acts. The repetition emphasizes the importance of examining one's true motivations when performing good deeds. Allah, who sees and knows everything, is certainly aware of all charitable acts, so there is no need to announce them to gain recognition. The verse suggests that if someone truly performed charitable acts for Allah's sake, they would not feel compelled to broadcast their generosity to others. This highlights the spiritual principle that righteous deeds should be performed with the intention of pleasing Allah rather than impressing people, and that seeking public acclaim for good works can diminish their spiritual value."

      "text": "The verse continues the same theme, reinforcing the message about the futility of publicizing one's charitable deeds while claiming to do them for Allah's pleasure. This repetition serves to deeply embed the lesson about sincerity in good works and the danger of showing off. The consistent questioning of the person's motives reveals the spiritual corruption that occurs when good deeds become vehicles for self-promotion rather than genuine service to Allah and humanity. True charity and righteousness should spring from humility and sincere desire to help others and please Allah, not from a need to enhance one's social standing or reputation. The verse challenges readers to examine their own motivations when performing good deeds and to strive for sincerity in their religious and charitable practices."

      "ayah": 10,
      "surah": 90,
      "text": "Allah has shown humans the two paths, which most commentators interpret as the paths of good and evil. However, another interpretation suggests this refers to the mother's two breasts. The word 'najd' literally means something elevated or raised, and can refer both to elevated clear paths and to two prominences. The preferred interpretation connects this to the natural, innate guidance that humans receive from birth, as mentioned in Surah Al-A'la. A newborn child immediately begins searching for its mother's milk and starts sucking as soon as it reaches the mother's breasts. Who gave this newborn the consciousness to search for its sustenance, and who taught it the specific use of tongue and lips at this stage? This awareness and guidance is part of the natural instinct that Allah has granted to the child, making this action one of Allah's signs. This verse emphasizes the concept of innate guidance that Allah provides to all His creation, enabling them to fulfill their basic needs and survive."

      "text": "The verse continues the description of the two paths or prominences that Allah has shown to humans, maintaining the same interpretation as the previous verse. Whether understood as moral paths of good and evil or as the physical reality of a mother's breasts that provide nourishment, the verse emphasizes divine guidance and provision for human needs. The repetition reinforces the concept that Allah has provided humans with both physical and spiritual guidance from the moment of birth. This natural guidance enables survival and growth, while also serving as a sign of divine wisdom and care. The verse highlights how even the most basic human functions and needs are surrounded by divine wisdom and represent manifestations of Allah's mercy and guidance for His creation."

      "text": "This verse reiterates the theme of Allah showing humans the two paths, continuing the emphasis on divine guidance provided to humanity. The repetition serves to reinforce the fundamental importance of recognizing and choosing the right path in life, whether this refers to moral choices between good and evil or the basic life-sustaining guidance provided from birth. The verse underscores that humans are not left without direction but are given clear indicators of what will benefit them and what will harm them. This divine guidance operates at multiple levels - from the instinctive knowledge that enables a newborn to seek nourishment to the moral and spiritual guidance provided through revelation and conscience. The provision of guidance also implies human responsibility to recognize and follow the right path."

      "surah": 90,
      "text": "The freeing of a neck refers to spending money to free a slave or paying off someone's debt to release them from bondage. This represents one of the most noble forms of charity that directly liberates human beings from various forms of servitude and financial oppression. The act of freeing slaves was considered among the highest forms of charitable giving in Islamic society, as it restored human dignity and freedom to those who had been enslaved. Similarly, paying off debts for those unable to do so themselves freed them from financial bondage and the stress and humiliation that comes with indebtedness. This type of charity addresses fundamental human needs for freedom and dignity, going beyond mere material assistance to restore people's autonomy and self-respect. Such acts of liberation represent the kind of meaningful social action that can help overcome the spiritual obstacles that prevent human moral development."

      "text": "Feeding people during days of hunger refers to providing food to the hungry during times of famine and scarcity. This act becomes particularly meritorious when done during periods of general hardship, especially when the giver himself is concerned about meeting the needs of his own family. The verse emphasizes charitable giving during the most difficult circumstances, when resources are scarce and the temptation to hoard for oneself and one's family is strongest. True generosity is tested not during times of abundance, but during periods of scarcity when sharing requires genuine sacrifice and trust in divine providence. This type of charity demonstrates a person's prioritization of community welfare over personal security, reflecting deep faith and social consciousness. Such acts of feeding the hungry during desperate times represent the highest form of human compassion and solidarity."

This repetition underscores the exceptional merit of providing sustenance when it is most desperately needed and when the giver faces personal anxiety about their own family's needs. The act represents a triumph of compassion and social responsibility over natural self-preservation instincts. By feeding others when food is scarce, a person demonstrates profound trust in Allah's provision and deep commitment to community welfare. This type of charity tests the sincerity of one's faith and compassion, as it requires genuine sacrifice rather than giving from surplus wealth. Such acts of generosity during difficult times create strong bonds of solidarity within communities and reflect the highest ideals of human cooperation and mutual care."

      "text": "This refers to helping the destitute person who is rolling in the dust due to extreme poverty and need. This difficult path represents the philosophy that was discussed in detail during the study of Surah Al-Hadid. This challenging path is actually the rock of love of wealth that stands blocking the way of goodness for the person concerned. When explaining verse 18 of Surah Al-Hadid, this was compared to a car's brake. The only way to cross this difficult path or release the car's brake is for a person to spend their wealth generously for Allah's pleasure in helping the needy and poor and in other good works. The way to cleanse the heart from the contamination of love of wealth is to sacrifice one's beloved wealth for the love of Allah. Remember, without removing the filth of love of wealth from the heart, a person cannot experience the sweetness of faith. This passage emphasizes that material attachment creates spiritual barriers that must be overcome through generous charitable giving and service to those in desperate need."

      "ayah": 17,
      "surah": 90,
      "text": "Then he becomes one of those who believed, with the word 'then' being very important and meaningful here. This means that first a person should cross this difficult path, plow the field of their heart through spending in Allah's way, clean out the weeds of love of wealth from their heart's soil through this means, and then plant the seed of faith in it. If they work in this sequence and manner, only then will the plant of faith spread its roots in the soil of their heart and bear fruit. The believers also enjoin one another to patience and enjoin one another to compassion. This theme appears in Surah Al-Asr with the words: 'Except those who believe and do righteous deeds and enjoin one another to truth and enjoin one another to patience.' Deep similarities exist between these two verses in terms of words and meaning, though the order of the mentioned terms differs. In Surah Al-Asr, righteous deeds are mentioned after faith, while in this verse, righteous deeds (serving the poor, needy, and orphans) are mentioned before faith. This sequence suggests that charitable action can prepare the heart for true faith by removing material attachments that obstruct spiritual development."

      "text": "These are the companions of the right hand, meaning those whose record of deeds will be given in their right hands on the Day of Judgment. The word 'yamin' also means good fortune, so the verse could mean that these are the fortunate people who, by walking on the path of guidance and righteousness, reached the stages of success and salvation. The companions of the right hand represent those who successfully fulfilled their worldly test by prioritizing spiritual values over material attachments and serving others in need. Their receiving their record of deeds in their right hand symbolizes divine approval and acceptance of their life's work. The association with good fortune emphasizes that true success lies not in worldly achievements but in spiritual accomplishments that earn divine pleasure. These individuals managed to overcome the natural human tendency toward selfishness and materialism, instead choosing the difficult path of generosity, service, and spiritual development."

      "text": "Those who denied Our signs are the companions of the left hand, meaning their record of deeds will be handed to them in their left hands. Just as 'yamin' means good fortune, the root of 'mash'amah' contains meanings of misfortune and ill luck - the phrase 'bad luck' is also used in Urdu. Therefore, another translation of this verse would be 'these will be the people of misfortune.' The Quran frequently mentions the success or failure in the afterlife through reference to the right-handed (companions of the right hand or companions of the right) and left-handed (companions of the left hand or companions of the left). Surah Al-Waqi'ah mentions three groups of humanity, with two being these right and left groups, while the third group is described as 'the foremost ones who are indeed the foremost - those are the ones brought near to Allah.' This third group consists of very special people among the people of Paradise, namely those who are brought near to the divine presence. The verse under study mentions those unfortunate people who will be given their record of deeds in their left hand and thrown into Hell."

      "text": "Fire will be closed upon them, trapping them completely so that like a pressure cooker, all the heat of the fire remains inside, giving them the most severe punishment. May Allah protect us! We pray to Allah that He protects us from such punishment and, through His mercy and forgiveness, includes us among the people of Paradise. Amen! The image of fire being sealed over the inhabitants of Hell emphasizes the completeness and inescapability of their punishment. Unlike worldly fires that allow some heat to escape, this divine punishment will be contained and concentrated, intensifying the suffering of those who rejected divine guidance and chose the path of selfishness and disbelief. The prayer that concludes this description reflects the natural human response to contemplating such severe consequences and emphasizes the importance of seeking divine mercy and protection through righteous living and sincere repentance."
