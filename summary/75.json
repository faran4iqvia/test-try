This oath serves as a powerful declaration that contradicts the skepticism of disbelievers who consider resurrection impossible. The denial expressed here is directed at the arguments of those who reject the possibility of life after death, not at the Day of Judgment itself. The Prophet's character and truthfulness serve as the strongest evidence for this oath, as his integrity in all matters has been universally acknowledged even by his opponents. This verse establishes the absolute certainty of the Day of Resurrection as a fundamental truth that Allah Himself guarantees through this solemn oath."

      "text": "Allah also swears by the self-reproaching soul, which refers to the human conscience that condemns wrongdoing and approves righteousness. This conscience serves as universal evidence for the Day of Judgment, as it is a reality that no believer, disbeliever, or atheist can deny. The existence of moral conscience proves the objective reality of right and wrong, which in turn necessitates ultimate accountability and justice. When people do wrong, their conscience causes internal distress and sleeplessness, proving that moral standards are inherent in human nature. If there were no ultimate distinction between good and evil, the conscience would not torment people for their misdeeds, making the human conscience the strongest proof for the necessity of a Day of Judgment where perfect justice will be established."

      "text": "This verse continues the explanation of the self-reproaching soul as evidence for resurrection and divine justice. The conscience serves as an internal witness that demands accountability for human actions, since earthly life does not provide complete justice for good and evil deeds. The universal recognition of conscience across all human cultures and religions provides undeniable proof that moral accountability is built into human nature. Since perfect justice cannot be achieved in this temporary world, the existence of conscience logically necessitates another realm where complete justice will be established. The self-reproaching nature of the human soul when confronted with wrongdoing serves as the most compelling evidence that resurrection and divine judgment are inevitable realities rather than mere possibilities."

This verse responds to those who consider resurrection impossible by highlighting Allah's infinite power and attention to the smallest details of human creation. The mention of fingertips specifically refers to the unique fingerprints that identify each individual, demonstrating Allah's capability to restore not just the general form but the exact specific characteristics of each person. This level of precision in resurrection shows that Allah's power extends to the minutest details of human identity and physical structure.

      "text": "The verse reveals that humans deny the afterlife primarily because they want to continue their sinful behavior without accountability. This denial is not based on rational consideration but on the desire to escape the moral constraints that belief in judgment would impose. People find it easier to reject the concept of afterlife rather than abandon their unlawful pleasures and corrupt practices. This attitude resembles a dove closing its eyes upon seeing a cat, foolishly believing that ignorance will provide protection from inevitable consequences. The verse exposes the real motivation behind theological denial - not intellectual difficulty but moral rebellion against divine authority and the desire to live without ethical boundaries or ultimate accountability."

Their question is posed sarcastically rather than from genuine curiosity or concern, demonstrating their rejection of the entire concept of divine accountability. The mocking tone of their inquiry shows that they consider the Day of Judgment to be an empty threat rather than a serious reality that requires preparation.

This reminder serves to counter human arrogance by highlighting the simple beginnings from which all human complexity and achievement develops. The reference to such humble origins demonstrates Allah's incredible power to create sophisticated beings from basic biological materials. This creative process from simple fluid to complex human being illustrates the divine capability to resurrect the dead, since creating from nothing is more remarkable than recreating what already existed.
