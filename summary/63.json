      "text": "This verse describes the behavior of hypocrites when they come to the Prophet, declaring with their tongues that they bear witness that he is indeed the Messenger of Allah. However, Allah knows that the Prophet is truly His messenger, but He also bears witness that these hypocrites are indeed liars in their testimony.\n\nThe hypocrites give testimony to the Prophet's messengership only with their tongues, while their hearts do not acknowledge this reality, making them liars. Their verbal profession contradicts their inner belief, which constitutes the fundamental characteristic of hypocrisy.\n\nThis represents the first stage of the disease of hypocrisy - constant lying in speech and behavior. The verse establishes the contrast between surface-level verbal testimony and genuine heart-based faith, showing how hypocrites use words to deceive while harboring disbelief internally.\n\nThe divine testimony confirms the Prophet's authentic status while simultaneously exposing the false nature of the hypocrites' claims, setting the stage for a detailed analysis of hypocrisy's various manifestations and stages throughout the chapter."

      "text": "This verse reveals how hypocrites use their oaths as shields and how they turn away from the path of Allah. They would swear false oaths to avoid participating in jihad and struggle, making excuses like claiming their wives were seriously ill with no one else to care for them.\n\nWhen the situation reaches the point of frequent oath-taking to avoid religious duties, the disease of hypocrisy has entered its second stage. The hypocrites employ deceptive tactics, using sacred oaths to legitimize their avoidance of the obligations that faith demands.\n\nTheir behavior represents a systematic turning away from Allah's path through calculated deception rather than honest disagreement. They abuse the sanctity of oaths to create false justifications for their unwillingness to sacrifice for the cause of truth.\n\nThe verse condemns this behavior as extremely evil, indicating that using religious language and sacred oaths to avoid religious responsibilities represents a particularly insidious form of spiritual corruption that undermines the very foundations of sincere faith and community solidarity."

      "text": "This verse explains that the hypocrites' condition stems from the fact that they believed and then became disbelievers, resulting in their hearts being sealed so they no longer understand. Their hypocrisy was not initially conscious deception intended to trick others from the beginning.\n\nWhen the call of Islam first reached them, their natural disposition testified that this was a true and righteous invitation, and at that time they believed with good intentions. They were granted the treasure of faith for a while, but they did not realize upon believing that stepping into this testimony of faith meant entering a place where trials and sacrifices would be demanded.\n\nAllah's clear command for believers includes being tested with fear, hunger, and losses in wealth, lives, and crops. However, the hypocrites had no understanding of this reality. Many among the Medinan hypocrites had embraced Islam following their tribal leaders, without understanding what faith practically required.\n\nAfter initially believing sincerely but with weak faith, these people became frightened when they saw difficulties and trials, causing them to waver. Unlike other weak believers who remained attached to faith despite their shortcomings and sought forgiveness when they erred, these individuals began avoiding faith's practical demands and covering their betrayal with false excuses, leading them down the path of hypocrisy. Consequently, Allah sealed their hearts, depriving them of true understanding and genuine comprehension."

      "text": "This verse describes the hypocrites' outward appearance and behavior, noting that when you see them, their physical forms impress you, and when they speak, you listen to their words. Physically, their personalities are very attractive and impressive, and being wealthy and socially influential, their speech receives attention in every forum.\n\nHowever, the verse reveals their true reality by comparing them to dry wood propped against a wall. In essence, these people are like dried timber that cannot even stand without support and must be leaned against a wall to remain upright, indicating their complete lack of inner strength and substance.\n\nDespite their impressive exterior, they are internally so cowardly and fearful that any loud sound or noise terrifies them. They interpret every danger as directed specifically at them and live in constant fear of sudden attacks or demands for jihad and fighting.\n\nThis represents the third stage of hypocrisy - they have become the real enemies who should be guarded against. Their enmity is particularly dangerous because it is hidden under the guise of friendship, making them more threatening than open enemies. The verse specifically warns the Prophet to be cautious of these internal enemies, comparing them to snakes hidden in sleeves, who are more dangerous than the open armies of Meccan polytheists."

      "text": "This verse describes the hypocrites' reaction when called to seek the Prophet's forgiveness for their mistakes. Since their hearts have developed hatred and enmity against the Prophet, they cannot genuinely come forward to admit their errors in such circumstances.\n\nWhen told to come so that Allah's Messenger may seek forgiveness for them, they turn their heads dismissively, saying superficially that yes, they will come, certainly they will come. However, their response is merely a gesture to avoid immediate confrontation while having no intention of actually following through.\n\nTheir behavior reveals the underlying pride and arrogance in their hearts, which prevents them from coming to the Prophet to seek forgiveness. They consider such an act beneath their dignity, thinking that they have some honor and status that would be compromised by repeatedly going to confess like criminals and receiving reproach.\n\nThis attitude demonstrates how hypocrisy ultimately leads to a complete breakdown in the relationship between the individual and divine guidance. Their false sense of honor and social standing becomes a barrier to spiritual redemption, showing how worldly pride can prevent genuine repentance and spiritual growth."

      "surah": 63,
      "text": "This verse declares that it is equal for the hypocrites whether the Prophet seeks forgiveness for them or does not seek forgiveness for them - Allah will never forgive them. This same theme appears in even stronger terms in Surah At-Tawbah, where it states that even if the Prophet were to seek forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah would never forgive them.\n\nThe number seventy is used idiomatically here, meaning that the Prophet's intercession can no longer benefit them at all. Their hearts have reached such a level of enmity against the Prophet that their forgiveness has become impossible.\n\nDespite these severe warnings, the Prophet's gentle nature and nobility had their own character. After the revelation of the verse in Surah At-Tawbah, the Prophet once smiled and said that if he knew that seeking forgiveness more than seventy times would result in forgiveness, he would increase beyond that number.\n\nThis demonstrates the Prophet's extraordinary compassion even for those who had reached the point of no return. However, the verse establishes that once hypocrisy reaches the stage where it generates active enmity against the Prophet and divine guidance, the possibility of redemption through normal means becomes closed, representing a spiritual point of no return."

      "text": "This verse identifies the hypocrites as those who say not to spend on those who have gathered around Allah's Messenger until they disperse. The hypocrites believed that if the people of Medina stopped financially supporting the immigrant Muslims, this entire group would scatter within a few days.\n\nThis statement reflects what Abdullah ibn Ubayy had said to the Ansaris during the mentioned quarrel - that if they withdrew their support from these homeless people, they would have fled long ago. The hypocrites saw the Muslim community's unity as dependent merely on material support rather than spiritual conviction.\n\nHowever, the verse responds that to Allah belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites do not understand this reality. The reference to heavens and earth encompasses the entire universe, indicating that divine provision comes from sources beyond human calculation or control.\n\nThe hypocrites' worldview was limited to material cause and effect, failing to comprehend that Allah's support for His messenger and the believing community operates through means beyond their understanding. Their attempt to undermine the Muslim community through economic pressure demonstrates their fundamental misunderstanding of how divine support sustains those who are truly committed to Allah's path."

      "ayah": 8,
      "surah": 63,
      "text": "This verse quotes the hypocrites saying that when they return to Medina, the mighty will surely expel the humble from there. In Arabic, the true meaning of honor relates to power and dominance, while the humiliated refers to the weak and insignificant.\n\nSince this incident occurred while returning from the expedition against Banu Mustaliq, the hypocrites' dialogue mentions returning to Medina. Abdullah ibn Ubayy had told people while inflaming emotions that when they returned to Medina, they should unite and decide that those with honor - the original inhabitants and sons of the soil - should expel these weak immigrants who have no standing.\n\nHowever, the verse responds that true honor belongs to Allah, His Messenger, and the believers, but the hypocrites do not know this. The incident that followed demonstrates this divine principle, as Abdullah ibn Ubayy's own son, who was a sincere and faithful companion, decided to teach his father a lesson.\n\nWhen the army returned to Medina, Abdullah (the son) stood in his father's path with his sword drawn, telling his father that he would not allow him to enter the city until he admitted that he was the humiliated one and that all honor belongs to Allah, His Messenger, and the believers. Despite his father's appeals to others and complaints that his own son was trying to kill him, Abdullah maintained his position and only allowed his father entry after he fulfilled this condition.\n\nThis incident illustrates how divine honor ultimately manifests through those who truly believe, even when they must oppose their own family members to uphold the truth."

      "text": "This verse begins the treatment section for the disease of hypocrisy, addressing believers not to let their wealth and children distract them from the remembrance of Allah. Just as medicine offers both preventive and curative treatments for diseases, both approaches are presented here for treating hypocrisy.\n\nThe verse identifies two specific things that cause people to become neglectful of Allah's remembrance: wealth and children. This same theme appears clearly in Surah At-Taghabun, stating that wealth and children are indeed sources of trial and testing.\n\nThe remembrance of Allah mentioned here does not mean only reciting praise and glorification constantly, but has the broader meaning that Allah should always be remembered, and based on this remembrance, one should remain ready to fulfill all obligations at all times.\n\nThe warning addresses the common contemporary condition where most people, when called toward Allah and religion, respond that they simply do not have time. Obviously, someone who has made a certain 'standard of living' their idol and is engaged day and night in its worship will not have time to turn toward the true God.\n\nTherefore, the preventive measure to avoid the contagion of hypocrisy is ensuring that Allah's remembrance never escapes one's mind, while simultaneously identifying the two most important factors that cause people to forget Allah's remembrance. Since the root cause of hypocrisy is love of this world, and the greatest manifestation of worldly love is love of wealth, liberation from this disease requires removing the love of wealth from the heart."

      "ayah": 10,
      "surah": 63,
      "text": "This verse instructs believers to spend from what Allah has provided them before death comes to any of them, lest they say at that time asking for respite to give charity and become among the righteous. The corresponding treatment for the disease of hypocrisy is spending in Allah's path (infaq).\n\nThe verse depicts a scene of intense regret when a person will wring their hands wishing they could spend their wealth in Allah's path. Today people are gathering wealth with both hands and spending extravagantly on home decoration and beautification, but a time will come when they must leave behind family, relatives, wealth, and property.\n\nAt that moment, a person will say with regret asking why Allah did not give them a little more time, so they could distribute all their wealth in His path, give everything in charity, and adopt the path of complete truthfulness and righteousness. However, this regret will produce no results at that time.\n\nThe verse establishes spending in Allah's path as the effective method for removing love of wealth from the heart. Those who succeed in this struggle achieve real success, as the Quran promises that those who give charity and lend Allah a beautiful loan will have it multiplied many times over with honorable reward, and those who believe in Allah and His messengers will be among the truthful and martyrs with their Lord.\n\nThis represents the curative treatment for hypocrisy - actively spending wealth in Allah's cause to purify the heart from the love of material possessions that forms the root of hypocritical behavior."

      "text": "This final verse states that Allah will never delay any soul when its appointed time comes. While there is one example of a nation's appointed time being postponed - the people of Prophet Yunus who received reprieve from punishment at the last moment - the individual appointed time of death for humans has never been delayed.\n\nThe verse concludes that Allah is well-informed of what people do, indicating His complete knowledge of human actions and motivations. Allah knows that even the panic and lamentation expressed at the time of death would actually be hypocritical in nature.\n\nEven if hypothetically some respite were granted, the love of wealth would return again, and people would once again hesitate and avoid spending in Allah's path. This reveals the deep-rooted nature of the disease of hypocrisy and materialism in human hearts.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the finality of death's appointment and the futility of last-minute regrets. It warns that the tendency to postpone spiritual obligations and righteous spending until later often results in missing the opportunity altogether, as death comes without warning and without possibility of extension.\n\nThis concluding message reinforces the urgency of the previous instruction to spend in Allah's path before it becomes too late, highlighting that genuine spiritual transformation must occur during the time of health and opportunity, not be left for imaginary future moments that may never come."
