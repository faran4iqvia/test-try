      "text": "This verse begins with a divine oath by time itself, declaring \"By time!\" or \"By the era!\" This oath serves as a solemn testimony to the profound truth that follows. The concept of time here encompasses all of human history and the entirety of the temporal existence that humanity experiences. When Allah swears by time, it indicates the significance of what is about to be revealed and the universal nature of the truth being presented.\n\nThe oath by time is particularly meaningful because time is the arena in which all human actions take place, and it is within the framework of time that human success or failure is determined. Time bears witness to the patterns of human behavior throughout history, serving as a constant reminder of the fleeting nature of worldly existence and the urgency of making the most of the opportunities presented to each individual during their limited time on earth."

      "text": "This verse delivers the stark declaration that \"Indeed, mankind is in loss.\" This represents a universal statement about the human condition, indicating that the default state of humanity is one of spiritual and ultimate loss. The loss mentioned here is not merely material or temporary, but refers to the ultimate failure to achieve the true purpose of human existence and the consequent spiritual bankruptcy that results from this failure.\n\nThe subsequent verse will outline four essential conditions for escaping this state of loss, but it's crucial to understand that fulfilling only one, two, or three of these conditions is insufficient for salvation from this loss. Success and salvation require complete adherence to all four conditions mentioned in the following verse. This emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the path to spiritual success and the impossibility of taking shortcuts or partial measures when it comes to ultimate spiritual achievement."

      "text": "This verse provides the complete solution for escaping the loss mentioned in the previous verse, outlining four essential conditions: \"Except for those who believe, do righteous deeds, advise each other to truth, and advise each other to patience.\" The first and foundational condition is faith (iman), which encompasses belief in Allah, belief in the messengership, belief in the afterlife, and all other articles of faith. This means understanding, gaining awareness of, and affirming the hidden and unseen realities of the universe.\n\nThe second condition involves translating this faith into righteous action. If a person truly believes in Allah, their actions and character must demonstrate that they are obedient servants of Allah who fear disobedience to Him. They must strive to make every action commanded by Allah and His Messenger part of their daily routine, while avoiding everything that Allah and His Messenger have forbidden.\n\nThe third condition is \"advising each other to truth\" (tawasi bil-haqq). This means that after accepting the truth personally and molding their practical life according to it, the individual must become a standard-bearer for promoting good and forbidding evil, actively engaging in the propagation and dissemination of the truth they have embraced.\n\nThe fourth and final condition is \"advising each other to patience\" (tawasi bil-sabr), which is the logical and necessary consequence of the third condition. Anyone who takes up the banner of promoting truth will inevitably face opposition from satanic forces and will have to traverse difficult valleys of trials and tribulations. On this path, one must not only maintain patience and steadfastness personally but must also encourage and counsel their companions and fellow travelers to do the same. As Luqman advised his son when counseling him about promoting good: \"O my son, establish prayer, enjoin what is right, forbid what is wrong, and be patient over what befalls you.\" Those traveling the path of truth should know in advance that this road passes through thorns of trials and tribulations, as Allah says: \"And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient.\""
