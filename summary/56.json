The phrase \"when the Occurring Event occurs\" emphasizes the certainty of the Day of Judgment. This event refers to the Day of Resurrection which humanity has been repeatedly warned about throughout divine revelations. The word \"Waqi'ah\" itself conveys the meaning of something that is bound to happen and cannot be avoided.\n\nThe verse sets the tone for the entire chapter by establishing that what is being described is not a possibility but an absolute certainty. The redundancy in the Arabic expression serves to emphasize the inevitability of this event, making it clear that there is no escape from what has been decreed."

Many poor companions of the Prophet, such as Abu Hurairah, Abu Darda, and Abu Dharr, despite their humble worldly circumstances, will attain the highest ranks in paradise due to their spiritual excellence and dedication to faith."

The resurrection body will be perfectly suited for eternal existence."
