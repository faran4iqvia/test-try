      "text": "This verse contains Allah's divine declaration: \"Indeed, We have given you Al-Kawthar.\" The term 'Al-Kawthar' is derived from 'kathra' meaning abundance, and its grammatical form indicates extreme multiplication beyond measure. It has been translated as 'abundant good' because it signifies something so abundantly given that its extent cannot be estimated or calculated.\n\nWhile some interpretations specifically refer to the Pool of Kawthar that will be in the field of resurrection from which the Prophet will quench the thirst of his community members, this is actually included within the broader meaning of 'abundant good.' Various commentaries mention twenty-five to thirty different explanations of what this abundant good encompasses. The greatest example of this abundant good given to the Prophet is the Quran itself, along with wisdom of the highest degree, as Allah says: 'He gives wisdom to whom He wills, and whoever is given wisdom has indeed been given abundant good.'\n\nAdditionally, the river Kawthar in Paradise, the blessings and benefits of prophethood, the religion of Islam, the abundance of companions, the elevation of remembrance, and the praised station (Maqam Mahmud) have all been considered manifestations of Kawthar. The essential meaning of this verse is that Allah has granted the Prophet everything that humanity needs in abundance, and everything that can serve as a source of distinction and excellence for the human race."

      "text": "This verse contains the divine command: \"So pray to your Lord and sacrifice.\" The word 'nahr' literally means to slaughter a camel, though it extends to sacrificial slaughter in general. This verse mentions two acts of worship that are specifically performed on the day of Eid al-Adha - first Muslims pray the Eid prayer, and then they perform the sacrifice of animals.\n\nThe combination of prayer and sacrifice represents the complete expression of gratitude and worship in response to Allah's abundant blessings mentioned in the previous verse. Prayer represents the spiritual aspect of worship - the direct connection and communication with Allah through formal acts of devotion. Sacrifice represents the material aspect of worship - the willingness to give up something valuable as an expression of gratitude and submission. Together, these two acts encompass both the spiritual and physical dimensions of worship, showing that gratitude for divine blessings should be expressed through comprehensive devotion that involves both the soul and material possessions."

      "text": "This verse delivers a powerful response to the Prophet's enemies: \"Indeed, your enemy - he will be cut off.\" The term 'shani' refers to one who harbors hatred and enmity, while 'abtar' comes from the root meaning to cut or sever. Arabs used this term for animals whose tails had been cut, and in common usage, it referred to a man who had no male offspring and whose lineage had no possibility of continuation.\n\nThis word was used by the Meccan polytheists to mock the Prophet when his sons Qasim and Abdullah (also known as Tayyib and Tahir) passed away in childhood. The enemies celebrated, thinking that since only daughters remained from his children, the Prophet's name and lineage would not continue after his death. They believed that whatever he represented would end with his lifetime, leaving no one to carry forward his legacy or mention his name.\n\nThe verse provides a divine response to this mockery by declaring that it is actually the Prophet's enemies who will be truly cut off. Allah promises to elevate the Prophet's name and remembrance, resulting in billions of followers who would carry his name and message throughout history. Meanwhile, those who mocked him would indeed be the ones without lasting legacy or remembrance. This prophecy has been fulfilled dramatically - the Prophet's name is remembered and revered by billions across the world, while the names of his specific enemies from that time have been forgotten or remembered only in the context of their opposition to him."
