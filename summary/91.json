      "text": "The opening verse begins with a divine oath by the sun, establishing it as a source of radiance and brilliance. The sun represents divine light and guidance, symbolizing the spiritual illumination that comes from following the path of righteousness. This celestial body serves as a constant reminder of Allah's power and the light of truth that shines upon humanity.\n\nThe significance of beginning with the sun demonstrates how divine guidance functions as a source of clarity, just as the sun provides physical light. This verse sets the foundation for understanding the spiritual metaphors that follow, where natural phenomena represent deeper spiritual truths about human nature and divine guidance."

      "text": "The second verse presents an oath by the moon when it follows the sun, highlighting the moon's role as a reflection of the sun's light. The moon represents those souls who reflect divine guidance without being the original source, symbolizing the righteous believers who mirror the light of divine truth.\n\nThis relationship between the sun and moon illustrates the concept of spiritual leadership and followership. While some are like the sun, being direct sources of divine light and guidance, others are like the moon, reflecting that same divine light to illuminate the darkness for those around them."

      "text": "An oath is taken by the day when it illuminates and reveals the sun. The day represents the time of action, awareness, and spiritual awakening when truth becomes manifest and clear. This illumination symbolizes moments of divine revelation and spiritual clarity when the path of righteousness becomes evident.\n\nThe day's function of revealing the sun emphasizes how divine guidance becomes apparent through specific circumstances and moments of enlightenment. It represents periods in human life when spiritual truths are made clear and the soul awakens to its higher purpose."

      "text": "The oath by the night when it covers the sun represents the periods of spiritual darkness, confusion, or trial that may temporarily obscure divine guidance. Night symbolizes the phases of life when truth may seem hidden or when the soul faces challenges that test its faith and resolve.\n\nHowever, this covering is temporary, and the night also serves a purpose in the divine plan. Just as physical night provides rest and preparation for the next day, spiritual nights of trial serve to strengthen the soul and deepen its appreciation for divine guidance when clarity returns."

      "text": "An oath is taken by the heaven and its construction, emphasizing the magnificence and perfection of divine creation. The heaven represents the ultimate spiritual realm and the perfection of divine order that governs all existence. Its construction demonstrates the meticulous planning and wisdom inherent in divine creation.\n\nThis verse draws attention to the harmony and balance found in the celestial realm, which serves as a model for the spiritual harmony that human souls should strive to achieve. The heaven's perfection contrasts with the potential for both good and evil within human nature."

      "text": "The oath by the earth and how it has been spread out represents the foundation upon which human life and spiritual development take place. The earth symbolizes the material realm where souls are tested and where the journey of spiritual purification occurs.\n\nThe spreading of the earth demonstrates divine mercy in providing a suitable environment for human growth and development. Just as the earth provides physical sustenance, it also serves as the arena where spiritual lessons are learned and character is developed through various experiences and challenges."

      "text": "An oath is taken by the soul and its perfect creation, acknowledging the divine craftsmanship involved in creating the human soul. The soul represents the spiritual essence of humanity, created with the capacity for both good and evil, and endowed with the potential for spiritual elevation or degradation.\n\nThis verse emphasizes the responsibility that comes with having a perfectly created soul. The soul's creation includes all the necessary faculties and capabilities needed for spiritual success, making each individual accountable for the choices they make in their spiritual journey."

      "ayah": 8,
      "surah": 91,
      "text": "This verse reveals that Allah has inspired the soul with the knowledge of both evil and righteousness, providing each person with an innate moral compass. This divine inspiration represents the internal guidance system that helps distinguish between right and wrong, good and evil.\n\nThe inspiration of both wickedness and righteousness demonstrates that humans have been given complete freedom of choice in their spiritual journey. This internal knowledge serves as the foundation for moral accountability, as every soul inherently knows the difference between the path of righteousness and the path of corruption."

      "ayah": 9,
      "surah": 91,
      "text": "This verse declares that whoever purifies their soul achieves success and prosperity. Soul purification represents the process of spiritual refinement through righteous actions, sincere worship, and moral excellence. Success here refers to both worldly well-being and eternal salvation.\n\nThe concept of soul purification emphasizes active spiritual development rather than passive existence. It requires continuous effort to cleanse the soul from negative traits, cultivate positive qualities, and align one's actions with divine guidance. This purification leads to true fulfillment and divine pleasure."

      "ayah": 10,
      "surah": 91,
      "text": "The verse states that whoever corrupts and buries their soul in evil faces disappointment and failure. Soul corruption occurs when a person consistently chooses evil over good, allowing negative traits to dominate their character and actions.\n\nThis corruption represents a spiritual regression where the soul's natural inclination toward good is suppressed beneath layers of sin and moral negligence. The failure mentioned encompasses both the loss of divine guidance in this life and the severe consequences in the afterlife for those who deliberately corrupt their spiritual nature."

      "ayah": 11,
      "surah": 91,
      "text": "The narrative turns to the tribe of Thamud, who rejected divine guidance through their transgression and rebellion. Thamud represents communities that, despite receiving clear divine messages and prophetic guidance, choose to persist in their corrupt ways and reject the path of righteousness.\n\nTheir rejection serves as a historical example of collective soul corruption, where an entire community's spiritual degradation led to their ultimate destruction. This transition from individual soul purification to collective accountability demonstrates how spiritual principles apply at both personal and societal levels."

    {
      "ayah": 12,
      "surah": 91,
      "text": "This verse describes how the most wicked individual among the Thamud arose to commit the ultimate act of rebellion. This person represents the extreme manifestation of soul corruption, where an individual becomes so spiritually degraded that they lead others toward destruction.\n\nThe emergence of this wicked leader demonstrates how unchecked spiritual corruption can reach a point where it influences and corrupts entire communities. It shows the dangerous progression from personal spiritual neglect to becoming an agent of collective destruction and moral chaos."

      "ayah": 13,
      "surah": 91,
      "text": "The verse records the divine messenger's warning to the people about Allah's she-camel and their obligation to respect it. This warning represents the final opportunity for repentance and spiritual correction before divine punishment descends upon those who persist in rebellion.\n\nThe she-camel symbolizes divine signs and miracles that are sent to guide communities back to the right path. The warning emphasizes that divine mercy always precedes divine justice, giving people every opportunity to recognize their errors and return to righteousness before facing consequences."

      "ayah": 14,
      "surah": 91,
      "text": "This verse describes how the people rejected the warning and committed the act of killing the she-camel, sealing their fate. Their action represents the ultimate rejection of divine guidance and the point of no return in their spiritual corruption.\n\nThe killing of the divine sign demonstrates how spiritual blindness can lead to acts of extreme rebellion against Allah. This action triggered divine wrath because it represented not just disobedience, but active opposition to divine mercy and guidance that had been repeatedly offered to them."

    {
      "ayah": 15,
      "surah": 91,
      "text": "The final verse describes how divine punishment completely destroyed the transgressing community, with Allah having no fear of the consequences of this action. This destruction represents divine justice in response to persistent rebellion and the corruption of souls.\n\nThe phrase about Allah not fearing consequences emphasizes divine sovereignty and the certainty of divine justice. When a community reaches the point of complete spiritual corruption and actively opposes divine guidance, divine punishment becomes inevitable and serves as a lesson for future generations about the serious consequences of soul corruption and spiritual rebellion."
