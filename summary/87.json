      "text": "The command is given to glorify the name of the Lord who is Most High and Supreme. The specific mention of \"name\" rather than just commanding to glorify Allah directly is significant because Allah's essence is beyond human comprehension and imagination. Our mental and spiritual connection with Allah can only be established through His beautiful names and attributes. This is why we are instructed in the Quran that all the beautiful names belong to Allah, and we should call upon Him by these names. When humans want to remember Allah or engage in His praise and glorification, they can only do so through reference to His magnificent names and attributes. The supremacy and exaltation of Allah is thus approached through understanding and invoking His various names that describe His perfect qualities."

      "text": "Allah is described as the One who created everything and then established perfect proportions and balance. He is also the One who determined the measure and destiny of all things and then provided them with natural guidance. These four actions - creation, proportioning, determining, and guiding - represent both the attributes of Allah and the different stages of the creative process. The creative process can be understood through the example of a building: creating the basic structure represents the initial creation, while decorating and finishing it represents the proportioning and balancing phase. The third stage involves determining the capabilities, capacity, potential, and limitations of each creation, which constitutes their destiny or predetermined nature. For example, while humans are the most honored of creations, they cannot fly in the air, whereas a small bird can easily soar through the skies. This represents the different destinies and capabilities assigned to different creatures."

      "text": "The verse continues describing Allah's creative process through determination of destiny and provision of guidance. After determining the measure and capabilities of each creation, Allah provides them with natural, instinctive guidance that enables them to fulfill their purpose in life. This innate guidance allows every creature to know its role and function - a goat knows it should eat grass, while a lion knows its diet consists of meat. Every living being conducts its life according to the plan and program that Allah has established for it. For humans, this guidance operates on two levels: first, the natural and instinctive guidance that Allah has granted to every human being as part of their innate nature, and second, the divine guidance that Allah has provided through revelation, prophets, and scriptures to complete and perfect the basic guidance already embedded in human nature."

      "ayah": 4,
      "surah": 87,
      "text": "This verse elaborates on the concept of divine determination and guidance, particularly as it applies to human beings. Unlike other creatures, humans have a unique position in creation where their destiny and guidance operate differently. Every human's capabilities and potential are determined through two main factors: their genetic inheritance received at birth, and the environment in which they grow and develop. The combination of these positive and negative factors creates a unique mold or framework for each individual's personality, which determines the boundaries of their potential. No human can exceed these divinely established limits, and Allah will evaluate each person according to their individual capacity and circumstances. This principle ensures divine justice, as Allah does not burden any soul beyond its capability, and each person will be judged based on their sincere efforts within their particular circumstances rather than by absolute standards."

      "ayah": 5,
      "surah": 87,
      "text": "Allah brings forth vegetation from the earth and then causes it to wither and become dark debris. This verse illustrates the natural cycle of growth and decay that operates according to Allah's established system. Plants and vegetation grow from the earth through divine blessing and then eventually decompose and return to the soil, completing the cycle of life and death. This natural process serves as a sign of Allah's power over life and death, and demonstrates the temporary nature of all worldly phenomena. The cycle of vegetation - from growth to withering - also serves as a metaphor for human life and the inevitable reality that all living things must face their appointed time of decline and return to their Creator."

      "text": "Allah promises the Prophet that He will teach him the Quran and that he will not forget it. This divine assurance guarantees the preservation of the Quran in the Prophet's memory, ensuring that no part of the divine revelation would be lost. This verse addresses concerns about memorization and retention of the Quran, providing divine reassurance about its preservation. The theme is similar to what appears in Surah Al-Qiyamah, where the Prophet is instructed not to move his tongue hastily trying to memorize the revelation, as Allah Himself will ensure its collection and preservation. This divine guarantee of memorization represents one aspect of the miraculous preservation of the Quran, demonstrating Allah's commitment to maintaining His final revelation in its pure and complete form for all humanity."

      "ayah": 7,
      "surah": 87,
      "text": "The exception \"except what Allah wills\" serves to demonstrate Allah's absolute power and sovereignty over all affairs. This phrase does not suggest that the Prophet actually forgot any part of the Quran, but rather emphasizes that nothing occurs without Allah's permission and will. Allah has power over all things, including human memory, and if He wished to remove something from someone's memory, they would be unable to retain it regardless of their efforts. This exception clause is similar to other Quranic expressions that emphasize Allah's unlimited power while making absolute statements. The verse also affirms that Allah knows both what is spoken openly and what is kept hidden, demonstrating His complete knowledge of all affairs, whether apparent or concealed from human observation."

      "ayah": 8,
      "surah": 87,
      "text": "Allah promises to gradually lead the Prophet to ease and success. The Arabic word used indicates a gradual process rather than immediate transformation, suggesting that Allah will progressively create pathways through difficulties and guide the Prophet toward great ease and victory. This refers to both worldly success in the struggle for establishing the religion and the ultimate reward of Paradise in the afterlife. While Allah could instantly defeat all enemies and grant immediate universal belief, His wisdom and divine plan involve a gradual process of success and victory. This gradual approach serves important purposes in the divine strategy for establishing truth and testing humanity. The promise of progressive ease provides encouragement during times of hardship and demonstrates Allah's support for His messenger's mission."

      "text": "The Prophet is instructed to continue giving reminders and warnings if the reminder proves beneficial. However, this does not mean that the Prophet should only preach when people are receptive to the message or showing positive response. The command to give reminders is not conditional upon immediate acceptance or visible results from the audience. Rather, the instruction emphasizes the importance of consistent delivery of the divine message regardless of the immediate reception. The effectiveness of reminders depends on various factors including the spiritual state and willingness of the recipients, but the messenger's duty is to convey the message faithfully. This verse establishes the principle that divine guidance should be continuously offered even when immediate results are not apparent."

      "text": "Those who have fear of Allah will benefit from and accept the reminders and admonitions. The effectiveness of divine guidance depends significantly on the spiritual condition and attitude of the recipients. Those who possess consciousness of Allah and awareness of their accountability will be receptive to divine reminders and will benefit from them. The Prophet is encouraged to continue delivering new revelations to the people, as this will certainly increase the knowledge and faith of the believing companions. Fear of Allah creates a receptive heart that is open to guidance and willing to accept correction and direction. This spiritual receptivity is essential for benefiting from divine reminders, while those lacking this consciousness remain largely unaffected by even the most powerful messages."

      "text": "The verse reiterates that those who fear Allah will take heed and benefit from divine reminders. This repetition emphasizes the crucial role of God-consciousness in spiritual receptivity and growth. When the Prophet conveys divine guidance to people, those with sincere hearts and genuine concern for their spiritual welfare will accept the message and derive benefit from it. The consistent delivery of new revelation serves to continuously increase the knowledge and strengthen the faith of believers. This ongoing process of receiving and implementing divine guidance represents the natural progression of spiritual development for those who maintain proper reverence for Allah. The fear of Allah mentioned here is not mere anxiety but rather a profound awareness of divine presence and accountability that motivates righteous action."

      "text": "This verse continues the theme that those who fear Allah will benefit from reminders and guidance. The emphasis on God-consciousness as a prerequisite for spiritual benefit highlights the importance of maintaining proper spiritual attitude when receiving divine instruction. True receptivity to divine guidance requires humility, sincerity, and recognition of one's need for Allah's direction. Those who approach divine reminders with the right spiritual disposition will find them transformative and beneficial for their spiritual growth. The repeated emphasis on this principle throughout these verses underscores its fundamental importance in the process of spiritual development and the effective transmission of divine knowledge to sincere seekers."

      "text": "In Hell, the condemned person will neither die nor remain alive, representing a state of perpetual torment without relief. This characteristic of Hell is also mentioned in Surah Al-Muddathir, where it states that Hell neither spares nor leaves anything untouched. The nature of punishment in the afterlife involves a unique existence where the suffering individual cannot escape through death, yet cannot find peace in life. This eternal state represents the ultimate consequence of rejecting divine guidance and persisting in wrongdoing. The torment is designed to be continuous without the mercy of death as an escape, emphasizing the seriousness of spiritual choices made in worldly life and the permanent nature of consequences in the hereafter."

      "ayah": 14,
      "surah": 87,
      "text": "Those who purify themselves will indeed be successful, referring to the purification of the soul and spirit. The human soul is fundamentally noble and elevated in its original creation, as mentioned in Surah At-Tin where it states that humans were created in the most excellent form. However, when the soul is confined within the physical body and sent to this world, it temporarily descends from its elevated position to a lower state, also referenced in Surah At-Tin. The primary goal of worldly life should be for humans to elevate themselves from this lowered state back to spiritual heights. Success depends on achieving this elevation through controlling bodily desires and nourishing the soul. This requires a two-pronged approach: weakening animalistic impulses while strengthening spiritual faculties. The month of Ramadan exemplifies this dual program - fasting during the day weakens physical desires while night prayers provide spiritual nourishment, enabling the soul to achieve elevation and closeness to Allah."

      "text": "The successful person remembers the name of their Lord and performs prayer, representing the practical implementation of spiritual purification. This verse describes the pattern observed in Friday congregational prayers, where Allah's remembrance through the sermon precedes the actual prayer. The Prophet's practice during Friday prayers involved delivering two brief sermons with a pause between them, during which he would sit. These sermons included recitation of Quranic verses and reminders to the people. The Prophet's sitting between the two sermons was not due to fatigue but rather to formally structure his address into two distinct parts, which served as substitutes for two of the four units normally prayed for the noon prayer. In those days, since all listeners understood Arabic, the Quranic message penetrated hearts directly without need for extensive explanation. The importance of remembrance and reminder during Friday gatherings is emphasized by the hadith describing how angels record the attendance of early arrivals and then close their registers to listen to the divine remembrance when the prayer leader begins."

      "ayah": 16,
      "surah": 87,
      "text": "Humans tend to prefer worldly life over the afterlife, which represents the fundamental challenge in spiritual development. The ultimate success or failure of a person depends entirely on their priorities and choices. If someone plans their affairs giving precedence to success in the afterlife while maintaining contentment regarding worldly matters, they will be successful. However, if their approach is the opposite, their path leads to destruction and ruin. This verse identifies the core spiritual disease affecting worldly Muslims - prioritizing worldly interests over afterlife concerns. The fundamental reason for this misplaced priority is that worldly gains and losses are immediately visible and tangible, while the consequences of the afterlife remain unseen. This leads people to accept even minor worldly benefits in exchange for severe afterlife punishment, as described in Surah An-Nisa regarding those who wrongfully consume orphans' wealth, essentially filling their stomachs with fire."

    {
      "ayah": 17,
      "surah": 87,
      "text": "The verse reiterates that people prefer worldly life, continuing the analysis of misplaced priorities that determine spiritual success or failure. Human tendency to prioritize immediate, visible benefits over long-term spiritual consequences represents a fundamental weakness in human nature. This natural inclination toward the immediate and tangible over the delayed and unseen affects decision-making in critical ways. As mentioned in Surah Al-Qiyamah, people love what is immediate and quick while neglecting the afterlife. This preference for immediate gratification over eternal benefit explains why individuals may choose minor worldly gains even when they know such choices may result in severe punishment in the hereafter. The visible nature of worldly benefits contrasts sharply with the unseen nature of afterlife consequences, making it challenging for people to make choices based on long-term spiritual welfare rather than short-term material advantage."

      "ayah": 18,
      "surah": 87,
      "text": "These teachings were also contained in the earlier scriptures, indicating that the fundamental message of prioritizing the afterlife over worldly concerns represents the essential core of all divine guidance. The basic principle that humans should prefer the eternal over the temporary, and the afterlife over worldly life, has been consistent throughout divine revelation. This fundamental truth about proper priorities has been mentioned in previous heavenly scriptures as well, demonstrating the continuity and consistency of divine guidance across different eras and peoples. The preference for the afterlife over worldly concerns represents the essence of spiritual wisdom and the core message that all divine messengers brought to humanity. This universal principle transcends specific religious contexts and represents the fundamental choice that determines spiritual success or failure."

      "ayah": 19,

      "text": "These teachings were specifically mentioned in the scriptures of Abraham and Moses. While the scriptures of Moses still exist in some form today, the scriptures of Abraham are no longer apparently available in their original form. There is an opinion that suggests the Hindu Upanishads may be corrupted remnants of Abraham's original scriptures, though this remains a matter of scholarly interpretation. The reference to these earlier scriptures emphasizes the continuity of divine guidance and the consistent message delivered through different prophets across history. The core teachings about spiritual priorities and the relationship between worldly life and the afterlife have remained constant throughout divine revelation, demonstrating the universal nature of these fundamental spiritual principles that transcend specific cultural and historical contexts."
