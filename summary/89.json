      "text": "Allah swears by the dawn, referring specifically to the dawn of the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah when the sacrifice is performed after the Fajr prayer. This opening oath represents one of the challenging passages in the Quran regarding divine oaths, with multiple scholarly interpretations offered. The general consensus identifies this dawn as that of the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah, which holds fundamental and special importance in relation to the rituals of Hajj. This particular dawn marks the beginning of the day when pilgrims perform the sacrifice, completing one of the essential rites of the pilgrimage. The significance of this specific time emphasizes the sacred nature of the Hajj period and the divine blessing associated with these blessed moments."

These nights include the night of the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah itself, as it would have passed before the dawn of that day. The ten nights represent a period of special sanctity and spiritual significance in the Islamic calendar, particularly during the Hajj season. These nights are considered among the most blessed times of the year when good deeds are especially meritorious and divine mercy is abundant. The oath by these nights emphasizes their extraordinary spiritual value and the importance of utilizing them for worship and spiritual reflection."

Since the moon is not visible simultaneously in all regions of the world, there will be differences in the even and odd nights across different areas. For example, a night that is odd in Pakistan might be even in Saudi Arabia due to the lunar calendar differences. This oath encompasses the concept of divine wisdom in the alternation of time and the special significance given to certain nights over others. The even and odd pattern reflects the divine order and balance that characterizes all of creation."

This repetition emphasizes the importance of recognizing divine signs in the pattern of time and the special blessing attached to certain periods. The concept of even and odd represents the mathematical precision and divine wisdom that governs the universe, including the spiritual calendar that guides believers' worship. The alternation between even and odd reflects the divine principle of balance and contrast that characterizes both the physical and spiritual realms."

This rhetorical question emphasizes that these various elements - the dawn, the ten nights, and the even and odd - serve as witnesses and evidence for the content that follows in the coming verses. The question is directed specifically at those who possess reason and intellect, indicating that understanding divine signs requires the proper use of mental faculties. Those who reflect carefully on these signs will recognize their significance and the divine wisdom they represent.

According to historical accounts, Iram was the title of the royal family that ruled the people of Ad, similar to how the Pharaohs ruled Egypt, the Nimrods ruled Iraq, and the Tubba ruled Yemen. They are specifically mentioned in connection with pillars because they gave special importance to columns in their construction and were the first to develop the technique of erecting large buildings on pillars. Archaeological discoveries reveal that one of their cities had thirty columns or minarets built on its walls. This city is said to have been specially developed by Shaddad, who was a great king of this people, and became famous in history as Shaddad's 'earthly paradise.'"

This verse can also be interpreted to mean that the standard and style of construction they achieved had never been accomplished by any other nation before them. Their physical prowess was legendary, and their architectural achievements were unprecedented in human history. The uniqueness of their civilization extended to both their personal capabilities and their collective achievements in building and construction. Their combination of extraordinary physical attributes and advanced building techniques made them a truly remarkable civilization that stood apart from all others in human history."

They skillfully carved large mountains to create beautiful, spacious houses and palaces by cutting directly into the rock formations. The houses and palaces they carved from mountains still exist today as testimony to their remarkable skills. Their expertise in stone-cutting and rock-carving was unparalleled, allowing them to create elaborate dwellings that were both functional and aesthetically impressive. These architectural remains serve as lasting evidence of their advanced civilization and technical capabilities. Their ability to transform solid rock into livable spaces demonstrated both their practical skills and their artistic sensibilities."

      "text": "Allah mentions Pharaoh of the stakes, referring to his power and authority symbolized by stakes or pegs. The word 'stakes' can refer to both iron stakes and wooden pegs used to tie tent ropes. One interpretation is that this refers to the stakes of his army's tents, as he possessed very large armies and great pomp and power. When he went on military campaigns, a large supply of stakes accompanied them to set up the army's tents. Another interpretation is that when he became angry with someone, he would crucify them and drive stakes through their bodies as a form of torture. Both interpretations highlight the tyrannical nature of his rule and the extent of his worldly power, which he used to oppress and terrorize his people."

The repetition serves to underscore the systematic nature of his cruelty and the way he used his power to intimidate and control his people. Whether referring to military might through his vast armies or to instruments of torture used against opponents, the stakes represent the foundation of his earthly authority built on fear and oppression. This description sets up the contrast between worldly power based on force and true divine authority based on justice. The mention of stakes serves as a symbol of how temporal rulers often rely on coercion rather than legitimate authority."

      "text": "These nations spread much corruption and mischief in their lands through their rebellion against Allah's commands and system. When people rebel against Allah's commands and His established order, the result manifests as oppression and injustice against God's creation, and this oppression and injustice is precisely what constitutes corruption. Similar to how today the anti-human policies of G-7 and G-9 nations are becoming causes of corruption in the world, their oppressive policies have created dangerous confrontation between capitalists and the deprived classes under the title of North versus South. The time is not far when the dangerous consequences of this situation will become a noose around their own necks. Corruption on earth always arises from human rebellion against Allah's commands, as stated in Surah Ar-Rum that corruption has appeared on land and sea because of what people's hands have earned."

The metaphor of a whip suggests swift, decisive, and painful retribution that came upon them as a consequence of their persistent defiance of divine guidance. Their punishment was comprehensive, affecting not just individuals but entire civilizations that had built their power on oppression and corruption. The complete erasure of their traces serves as a warning to future generations about the ultimate consequences of systematic rebellion against divine law. Despite their apparent strength and advanced capabilities, they could not withstand the divine punishment when it came upon them."

      "text": "Indeed, your Lord is ever watching and lying in wait for the rebellious and corrupt. Whether it is an individual or a nation, whoever rebels against Allah will certainly be punished by Him for this crime. This verse establishes the principle of divine surveillance and inevitable accountability that governs both individual and collective human behavior. Allah's watching is not passive observation but active monitoring that leads to appropriate consequences for those who transgress divine boundaries. The concept of being 'in wait' suggests that divine justice may be delayed but is never abandoned, and that wrongdoers will ultimately face the consequences of their actions. This serves as both a warning to the rebellious and a comfort to the oppressed that justice will eventually prevail."

This repetition emphasizes the certainty and universality of divine accountability, ensuring that no act of rebellion or corruption goes unnoticed or unpunished. The divine watching encompasses all levels of society, from individual transgressors to entire nations that systematically violate divine law. This constant surveillance serves as a deterrent to wrongdoing and provides assurance that divine justice operates continuously, even when its effects are not immediately visible. The patience of divine justice should not be mistaken for divine indifference, as ultimate accountability is guaranteed for all who transgress divine boundaries."

This consistent emphasis throughout multiple verses underscores the fundamental importance of recognizing divine justice as an active force in human affairs. The repetition serves to ingrain this truth deeply in the consciousness of believers and to warn those who might be tempted to transgress divine boundaries. The certainty of divine punishment for rebellion and corruption provides a foundation for moral behavior and social justice. Those who understand this principle will be motivated to align their actions with divine guidance rather than risk the consequences of rebellion."

      "text": "The verse emphatically declares 'Not at all!' rejecting the misconceptions that follow. This passage represents a unique and distinguished position in the entire Quran in terms of its content and message. The human attitudes mentioned here regarding abundance and scarcity do not appear to contain any obvious defect or contamination of shirk (polytheism). Both statements are completely in accordance with the principle of monotheism, attributing honor and humiliation in relation to wealth and poverty to Allah rather than to any deity or god. Superficially, this appears to be an acknowledgment of Allah's statement that He honors whom He wills and humiliates whom He wills. However, the fundamental problem with these statements is that human thinking has taken the abundance and scarcity of sustenance as measures of honor and humiliation, ignoring the reality that Allah's provision is always a test and trial. Allah sometimes tests people with abundant wealth and sometimes tests them with economic hardship. From this perspective, anyone who considers abundance or scarcity of wealth as measures of honor and humiliation has been deceived."

      "surah": 89,
      "text": "People do not encourage one another to feed the poor, revealing a fundamental social and spiritual deficiency. Encouraging others to perform good deeds is particularly difficult because it requires that a person first be committed to those good deeds themselves. This verse actually draws attention to this human weakness, pointing out that people neither feed the hungry themselves nor encourage others to perform this noble work. The failure to encourage charitable acts reveals a deep-seated selfishness and lack of social consciousness that characterizes societies focused primarily on material accumulation. This deficiency in mutual encouragement represents a breakdown in community solidarity and shared moral responsibility. When people fail to promote charitable giving, it indicates that the values of compassion and social justice have been weakened in that society."

      "text": "People devour inheritance greedily, consuming everything available without regard for justice or proper distribution. This verse points to the unjust and unbalanced inheritance laws created by humans and also refers to how the powerful among them want to seize all inheritance through various tricks and pretexts. It should be noted that the Quran has given the world detailed, comprehensive, and balanced inheritance laws. Before Islam, in Arab society, the entire inheritance of the father was transferred to the eldest son, and all the younger siblings received nothing from it. Such unjust laws are still in effect in some countries of the world today. The greedy consumption of inheritance represents a fundamental violation of family rights and social justice, concentrating wealth in the hands of the few while depriving others of their rightful shares."

      "text": "People love wealth with excessive and overwhelming love, showing how material desires dominate their hearts and minds. The love of worldly wealth is deeply embedded in their hearts, controlling their priorities and decisions. It should be noted that in this pair of surahs - Surah Al-Fajr and Surah Al-Balad - glimpses of the civilization and customs of Arab society before the revelation of the Quran can be seen. Examples such as the powerful forcibly seizing inheritance, excessive love of wealth, and neglecting service to humanity due to this love were common in that society. This excessive attachment to material possessions represents a spiritual disease that prevents people from fulfilling their obligations to Allah and to other human beings. The overwhelming love of wealth creates a barrier to charitable giving and social responsibility."

This translation follows Shah Abdul Qadir's rendering, while his brother Shah Rafi uddin translated it as 'when the earth is broken into pieces.' The complete pulverization or crushing of the earth represents the total transformation of the physical universe that will precede the establishment of the final judgment. This cosmic event will mark the end of the current order and the beginning of the eternal phase of human existence. The thorough crushing of the earth symbolizes the temporary nature of all worldly achievements and the ultimate insignificance of material pursuits in the face of eternal realities."

Surah Al-Haqqah depicts a scene from the Day of Judgment where angels will be at its borders, and eight angels will bear the Throne of your Lord above them on that day. Surah Ar-Rahman describes the condition of the sky on that day as split open, becoming rose-colored like oil sediment. Contemplating the details mentioned in the Quran about the Day of Judgment gives the impression that the field of resurrection will be established on this very earth. The earth will be stretched flat and crushed completely smooth so that all its ups and downs will be eliminated. Mountains will be blown away like cotton balls. Then Allah's glorious descent will occur on earth, with eight angels descending with a special manifestation of Allah, while other angels will stand in rows."

When the earth is stretched and flattened, the boiling lava inside it will come out, creating the scene of Hell. On that day, humans will remember and take heed, but what benefit will remembrance be then! Shah Abdul Qadir translated this as 'on that day humans will remember,' meaning that on that day much will come back to human memory about what they brought with them from the world, and they will also receive admonition. But the admonition of that time will be of no benefit to them, as benefit would have come only if they had accepted admonition in the world. The emergence of Hell from the earth's core represents the physical manifestation of spiritual consequences that were hidden during worldly life."

      "text": "The person will say: 'Oh, if only I had sent ahead something for my life!' The word 'my life' here is particularly noteworthy, as at that time humans will realize that their real life is what has now begun, and they mistakenly considered worldly life as the real life, which was merely a prelude to this actual life. Human life actually begins from the realm of souls and continues through the world to eternity. The calculation of this long journey of life cannot be made by counting the months, years, days and nights of the world. Allama Iqbal expressed this philosophy by saying: 'Do not measure it by the standards of today and tomorrow - life is eternal, perpetually moving, always youthful!' Therefore, humans should realize that their worldly life is a small part of their eternal life's continuity, which Allah has selected for their test, and He created death as a sign of the conclusion of this test period so that every person's deeds can be examined."

      "text": "The verse reiterates the regretful cry of the person wishing they had sent something ahead for their real life. This repetition emphasizes the profound regret that will overwhelm those who failed to prepare for their eternal existence during their temporary worldly life. The realization that worldly life was merely a preparation phase for the actual life will be devastatingly clear, but this understanding will come too late to benefit them. The concept of 'sending ahead' refers to good deeds, charity, and spiritual preparation that could have secured their position in the eternal life. The emphasis on 'my life' shows the recognition that the afterlife represents the continuation and true fulfillment of human existence, while worldly life was merely a testing ground for determining one's eternal state."

The punishment that Allah will inflict upon the rebellious and corrupt will be unlike any punishment that could be administered by any other authority. This verse establishes the supremacy of divine justice and the incomparable nature of divine retribution for those who persistently rejected guidance and spread corruption. While the field of resurrection will present this terrifying scene for some, there will also be some fortunate people who will receive a completely different treatment. The contrast between the punishment of the wicked and the reward of the righteous will be stark and absolute, demonstrating the perfect justice of divine judgment."

The tranquil soul represents the highest level of spiritual achievement, where a person has found complete peace and satisfaction in submission to Allah. This state of tranquility comes from having successfully navigated the trials and tests of worldly life while maintaining unwavering faith and devotion. Such souls achieved inner peace through their consistent choice to prioritize spiritual values over material temptations. Their tranquility reflects the harmony they maintained between their actions and their beliefs throughout their earthly existence."

This same condition of fortunate people is described in Surah Al-Bayyinah with the words 'Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Allah.' This mutual satisfaction represents the ultimate goal of human existence and the perfect culmination of a life lived in accordance with divine guidance. The pleasure of Allah with His servant reflects the success of that soul in fulfilling its purpose and obligations during worldly life. Correspondingly, the soul's pleasure with Allah demonstrates its complete acceptance of divine wisdom and justice, even in matters that may have seemed difficult during earthly trials."

These righteous servants are identified in Surah An-Nisa as those who obey Allah and the Messenger, and they will be with those upon whom Allah has bestowed His favor - the prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous, and what excellent companions they are! This invitation represents the ultimate honor and privilege available to human beings - to be counted among the ranks of the most noble and blessed souls in creation. The companionship of prophets, truthful believers, martyrs, and righteous people represents the highest form of spiritual society and eternal fellowship.

The invitation to join the ranks of Allah's favored servants and enter His Paradise represents the culmination of a life lived in accordance with divine guidance. Considering the elevated ranks of these blessed people and our own sense of spiritual inadequacy, our prayer for their companionship may seem like 'small mouth, big talk,' but still the heart spontaneously prays: 'O Allah, our Lord, make us among them... Amen!' This final invitation completes the contrast between the fate of the rebellious who face punishment and the tranquil souls who receive the ultimate reward. The progression from being addressed as a tranquil soul to being invited into Paradise shows the stages of divine recognition and honor bestowed upon the faithful."
